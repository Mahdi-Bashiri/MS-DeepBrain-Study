    METHODOLOGY
    -----------

    Data Processing:
    1. Raw data extraction from study database
    2. Exclusion of participants with missing age or burden ratio data
    3. Conversion to appropriate numeric formats
    4. Outlier detection and validation

    Statistical Analysis:
    - Descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, range
    - Correlation analysis: Pearson correlation between age and burden measures
    - Polynomial regression: Second-degree polynomial fitting with age normalization

    Visualization Approach:
    - Scatter plots: Individual participant data points (alpha=0.6, size=50)
    - Trend lines: Polynomial regression curves (dashed lines, alpha=0.8)
    - Color coding: HC (#2ca02c), MS (#ff7f0e)
    - Logarithmic scaling: Applied to WMH burden panels (B, D, F) due to wide value range

    MEASURES ANALYZED
    -----------------

    Ventricular Ratio (VentricleRatio):
    - Definition: Ratio of ventricular volume to total brain volume
    - Units: Percentage (%)
    - Clinical significance: Marker of brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement
    - Expected pattern: Generally increases with age, potentially accelerated in MS

    White Matter Hyperintensity Ratio (WMHRatio):  
    - Definition: Ratio of WMH volume to total white matter volume
    - Units: Percentage (%)
    - Scale: Logarithmic due to wide dynamic range
    - Clinical significance: Marker of white matter pathology and demyelination
    - Expected pattern: Increases with age, typically elevated in MS patients

    POPULATION STRATIFICATION
    -------------------------

    All Participants (Panels A, B):
    - Purpose: Overall population analysis combining all gender categories
    - Advantage: Maximum statistical power for detecting age-related trends
    - Consideration: May mask gender-specific effects

    Female Participants (Panels C, D):
    - Purpose: Gender-specific analysis in females
    - Clinical relevance: MS shows female predominance (~3:1 ratio)
    - Hormonal considerations: Estrogen effects on brain aging and MS progression

    Male Participants (Panels E, F):
    - Purpose: Gender-specific analysis in males  
    - Clinical relevance: Different MS disease course and progression patterns
    - Aging effects: Potentially different brain aging trajectories

    CLINICAL INTERPRETATION
    -----------------------

    Ventricular Burden Patterns:
    - Normal aging: Gradual ventricular enlargement expected with age
    - MS pathology: Accelerated atrophy may result in steeper age-related increases
    - Gender differences: May reflect hormonal influences on brain aging
    - Clinical threshold: Values >2.5% often considered abnormal (age-dependent)

    White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns:
    - Normal aging: Mild WMH accumulation, especially periventricular regions  
    - MS pathology: Extensive WMH burden, often young age onset
    - Logarithmic scaling: Accounts for exponential-like WMH progression
    - Clinical significance: Higher burden correlates with disability progression

    Group Comparisons:
    - HC vs MS: Expected higher burden in MS across all age ranges
    - Age interactions: MS may show different age-related progression rates
    - Gender stratification: Reveals sex-specific disease and aging patterns

    VISUALIZATION DESIGN RATIONALE
    -------------------------------

    Scatter Plot Selection:
    - Reveals individual participant variability
    - Shows data distribution and potential outliers  
    - Enables assessment of relationship linearity/non-linearity
    - Transparent points (alpha=0.6) prevent overplotting

    Polynomial Trend Lines:
    - Captures non-linear age-related changes
    - Second-degree polynomial balances fit quality and overfitting risk
    - Dashed lines distinguish from data points
    - Age normalization improves numerical stability

    Color Scheme:
    - HC: #2ca02c (consistent across all analyses)
    - MS: #ff7f0e (distinctive from HC)
    - High contrast ensures accessibility
    - Consistent with other study figures

    Logarithmic Scaling:
    - Applied to WMH burden due to wide dynamic range (0.001-10%+)
    - Improves visualization of both low and high values
    - Better reveals proportional relationships
    - Standard approach for highly skewed biomarker data

    QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES

    LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
    ------------------------------

    1. Cross-sectional Design:
       - Cannot establish causality in age-burden relationships
       - Cohort effects may confound age-related interpretations
       - Longitudinal follow-up needed for aging trajectory validation

    2. Sample Size Constraints:
       - Smaller subgroups (gender-stratified) have reduced statistical power
       - Regression stability may be compromised with few observations
       - Confidence intervals may be wide for some estimates

    3. Polynomial Regression Limitations:
       - May overfit with limited data points
       - Extrapolation beyond age ranges unreliable
       - Alternative non-parametric approaches may be more robust

    4. Burden Measure Considerations:
       - Measurement error affects correlation strength
       - Normalization methods may influence between-group comparisons
       - Scanner differences may introduce systematic bias

    RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL ANALYSES
    -------------------------------

    1. Statistical Testing:
       - ANCOVA for group comparisons adjusting for age
       - Interaction testing (group × age, group × gender × age)
       - Non-parametric alternatives for non-normal distributions

    2. Advanced Modeling:
       - Mixed-effects models accounting for scanner/site effects
       - Spline regression for flexible age relationship modeling
       - Machine learning approaches for pattern recognition

    3. Clinical Correlation:
       - Disability score associations with burden measures
       - Disease duration effects in MS subgroup
       - Medication effects on burden progression

    4. Methodological Validation:
       - Test-retest reliability assessment
       - Inter-rater agreement for manual measurements
       - Automated vs manual measurement comparison
