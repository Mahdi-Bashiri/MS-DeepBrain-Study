    ==========================================================

    Generated on: 2025-09-18 13:00:12

    OVERVIEW
    --------
    This analysis examines white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesion burden in the brain 
    comparing Healthy Controls (HC) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. The analysis 
    includes both absolute WMH area measurements and normalized WMH ratios, stratified 
    by age groups and gender.

    FIGURE DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    The figure consists of a 2x2 subplot layout:

    Layout Structure:
    - Top row: Healthy Controls (HC)
    - Bottom row: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients
    - Left column: Absolute WMH Area (mm²)
    - Right column: WMH Ratio (%)

    Subplot Details:
    1. Top-Left: HC WMH Area
    2. Top-Right: HC WMH Ratio  
    3. Bottom-Left: MS WMH Area
    4. Bottom-Right: MS WMH Ratio

    VISUALIZATION METHOD
    --------------------
    Chart Type: Stacked Area Plot
    - Each subplot uses stacked area charts to show gender-stratified data across age groups
    - Male data (bottom layer): Fills from 0 to male mean value
    - Female data (top layer): Fills from male mean to total (male + female) mean
    - This visualization allows comparison of both absolute values and gender contributions

    Color Scheme:
    - Male data: #1f77b4 (alpha=0.7)
    - Female data: #d62728 (alpha=0.7)

    AGE STRATIFICATION
    ------------------
    Age Groups: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+
    Age Bins: [(18, 29), (30, 39), (40, 49), (50, 59), (60, 69)]
    Age Centers (for plotting): ['23.5', '34.5', '44.5', '54.5', '64.5']

    The analysis stratifies data across these age groups to examine age-related changes 
    in lesion burden for both groups and genders.

    METRICS ANALYZED
    ----------------

    1. WMH Area (mm²):
       - Absolute measurement of total white matter hyperintensity volume
       - Column: TotalWMHArea
       - Units: Square millimeters (mm²)
       - Clinical significance: Larger values indicate greater lesion burden

    2. WMH Ratio (%):
       - Normalized measurement relative to total brain area/volume
       - Column: WMHRatio
       - Units: Percentage (%)
       - Clinical significance: Controls for individual brain size differences

    CLINICAL CONTEXT
    ----------------
    White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH):
    - Bright signal areas on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI sequences
    - Associated with small vessel disease, aging, and neurodegeneration
    - In MS: May represent demyelination, inflammation, or tissue damage
    - Age-related increase is normal but accelerated in pathological conditions

    Expected Patterns:
    - MS patients typically show higher WMH burden than healthy controls
    - Age-related increase in WMH burden in both groups
    - MS may show accelerated age-related progression
    - Gender differences may exist in lesion development patterns

    ADVANCED STATISTICAL APPROACH
    ------------------------------
    The analysis employs a sophisticated statistical testing framework:
    
    Normality Assessment:
    - Shapiro-Wilk tests performed on both groups (HC and MS) for each metric
    - Significance threshold: p < 0.05 indicates non-normal distribution
    - Results inform choice between parametric and non-parametric tests
    
    Statistical Test Selection:
    1. If both groups pass normality: Independent t-test (parametric)
    2. If one or both groups fail normality: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric)
    
    Effect Size Calculations:
    - Parametric tests: Cohen's d
      * Small effect: d = 0.2
      * Medium effect: d = 0.5  
      * Large effect: d = 0.8
    - Non-parametric tests: Effect size r (r = Z/√N)
      * Small effect: r = 0.1
      * Medium effect: r = 0.3
      * Large effect: r = 0.5
    
    For each combination of:
    - Group (HC vs MS)
    - Age group (5 categories)
    - Gender (Male vs Female)  
    - Metric (Area vs Ratio)
    
    The following statistics are calculated:
    - Sample size (N)
    - Mean ± Standard Deviation
    - Minimum and Maximum values
    - Median values
    - Interquartile ranges (for non-parametric reporting)
    
    STATISTICAL OUTPUT INTERPRETATION
    ---------------------------------
    
    Parametric Results (t-test):
    - Reports: Mean ± SD for both groups
    - Test statistic: t-value and degrees of freedom
    - p-value for significance testing
    - Cohen's d for effect size magnitude
    
    Non-parametric Results (Mann-Whitney U):
    - Reports: Mean ± SD AND Median [IQR] for both groups
    - Test statistic: U-value (or equivalent Z-score)
    - p-value for significance testing
    - Effect size r for magnitude assessment
    
    Normality Test Results:
    - Shapiro-Wilk p-values reported for each group
    - p < 0.05 indicates significant departure from normality
    - Informs test selection rationale

    INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
    -------------------------

    Stacked Area Plot Interpretation:
    - Height of bottom layer = Male mean value
    - Height of top layer = Female mean value  
    - Total height = Combined mean (male + female means)
    - Wider gaps between age points indicate larger differences
    - Steeper slopes indicate rapid changes with age

    Clinical Significance Thresholds:
    - Minimal lesion burden: < 500 mm² (approximate)
    - Mild lesion burden: 500-5000 mm²
    - Moderate lesion burden: 5000-15000 mm²
    - Severe lesion burden: > 15000 mm²
    (Note: These are approximate guidelines and may vary by study protocol)

    Expected Clinical Patterns:
    - HC group: Low baseline with gradual age-related increase
    - MS group: Higher baseline with potentially steeper age-related progression
    - Gender differences: May reflect hormonal or lifestyle factors
    - Age acceleration: MS may show earlier onset of lesion accumulation
    
    Statistical Significance Levels:
    - p < 0.001: Highly significant (strong evidence)
    - p < 0.01: Very significant (moderate to strong evidence)
    - p < 0.05: Significant (sufficient evidence)
    - p ≥ 0.05: Non-significant (insufficient evidence)
    
    Effect Size Interpretation:
    - Cohen's d or r values indicate practical significance
    - Large effect sizes may be clinically meaningful even if p > 0.05
    - Small p-values with small effect sizes may lack clinical relevance

    DATA QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS
    ----------------------------
    - Zero values in plots indicate no subjects in that age/gender combination
    - Small sample sizes may lead to unstable mean estimates
    - Standard deviations provide insight into data variability within groups
    - WMH measurements are sensitive to MRI acquisition parameters
    - Manual/automated segmentation differences may affect absolute values
    - Ratios help normalize for technical and anatomical variations
    - Normality violations automatically trigger non-parametric alternatives

    LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
    ------------------------------
    1. Sample Size Variations:
       - Some age/gender combinations may have small sample sizes
       - Unbalanced groups may affect statistical power
       - Non-parametric tests more robust to unequal sample sizes
    
    2. Multiple Comparisons:
       - Two separate statistical tests performed (area and ratio)
       - Consider Bonferroni correction: α = 0.05/2 = 0.025
       - Family-wise error rate may be inflated without correction

    3. Age Grouping Effects:
       - Discretized age groups may mask continuous age effects
       - Age bin boundaries are predetermined and may not reflect natural breakpoints
       - Consider continuous age modeling for more detailed analysis

    4. Lesion Measurement Considerations:
       - WMH detection depends on MRI sequence parameters
       - Segmentation methods (manual vs automated) may introduce variability
       - Small lesions may be missed due to resolution limitations
       - Partial volume effects at tissue boundaries

    5. Stacked Area Representation:
       - Visual emphasis on gender differences may overshadow group differences
       - Direct comparison between groups requires careful interpretation
       - Mean values used may not reflect distribution skewness

    6. Statistical Assumptions:
       - Automatic normality testing with Shapiro-Wilk (sensitive to large samples)
       - Independence assumption may be violated in related subjects
       - Equal variances assumed for t-tests (consider Welch's t-test alternative)
