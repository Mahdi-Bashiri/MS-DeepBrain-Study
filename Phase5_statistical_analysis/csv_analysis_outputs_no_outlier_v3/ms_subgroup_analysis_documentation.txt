    =========================================================

    Generated on: 2025-09-18 13:00:15

    OVERVIEW
    --------
    This analysis examines white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesion subtypes specifically 
    in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. The analysis stratifies lesions by anatomical 
    location and provides detailed comparisons across age groups, gender, and measurement 
    types (absolute area vs. normalized ratios).

    FIGURE DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    The figure consists of a 3x2 subplot layout (16" width x 18" height):

    Layout Structure:
    - Row 1: All MS Patients (combined analysis)
    - Row 2: Female MS Patients only
    - Row 3: Male MS Patients only
    - Left Column: Absolute WMH Subtype Areas (mm²)
    - Right Column: WMH Subtype Ratios (%)

    Subplot Details:
    1. Top-Left: All MS - WMH Subtype Areas
    2. Top-Right: All MS - WMH Subtype Ratios
    3. Middle-Left: Female MS - WMH Subtype Areas  
    4. Middle-Right: Female MS - WMH Subtype Ratios
    5. Bottom-Left: Male MS - WMH Subtype Areas
    6. Bottom-Right: Male MS - WMH Subtype Ratios

    VISUALIZATION METHOD
    --------------------
    Chart Type: Three-Layer Stacked Area Plot
    - Each subplot uses three-layer stacked area charts showing lesion subtypes across age groups
    - PEWMH layer (bottom): Fills from 0 to PEWMH mean value
    - PAWMH layer (middle): Fills from PEWMH to PEWMH + PAWMH mean
    - JCWMH layer (top): Fills from PEWMH + PAWMH to total mean
    - This visualization shows both individual subtype contributions and total lesion burden

    Color Scheme:
    - PEWMH: #8B0000 (alpha=0.8)
    - PAWMH: #FF8C00 (alpha=0.8)  
    - JCWMH: #FFD700 (alpha=0.8)

    AGE STRATIFICATION
    ------------------
    Age Groups: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+
    Age Bins: [(18, 29), (30, 39), (40, 49), (50, 59), (60, 69)]
    Age Centers (for plotting): ['23.5', '34.5', '44.5', '54.5', '64.5']

    The analysis stratifies data across these age groups to examine age-related changes 
    in lesion subtype distribution for MS patients.

    LESION SUBTYPES ANALYZED
    ------------------------

    1. PEWMH (Periventricular White Matter Hyperintensities):
       - Location: Adjacent to the ventricular system
       - Clinical significance: Often associated with MS pathology and severity
       - Area Column: TotalPeriArea
       - Ratio Column: peri_wmh_ratio

    2. PAWMH (Paraventricular White Matter Hyperintensities):
       - Location: Near but not directly adjacent to ventricles  
       - Clinical significance: May represent different pathophysiological processes
       - Area Column: TotalParaArea
       - Ratio Column: para_wmh_ratio

    3. JCWMH (Juxtacortical White Matter Hyperintensities):
       - Location: At the interface between white and gray matter
       - Clinical significance: Associated with cortical involvement in MS
       - Area Column: TotalJuxtArea
       - Ratio Column: juxta_wmh_ratio

    CLINICAL CONTEXT
    ----------------
    MS Lesion Distribution Patterns:
    - MS lesions preferentially affect certain brain regions
    - Periventricular regions are classically involved in MS
    - Juxtacortical lesions may indicate disease progression
    - Age-related changes may reflect disease evolution or natural aging

    Expected Clinical Patterns:
    - PEWMH typically most prominent in MS patients
    - Age-related increase in all lesion subtypes
    - Gender differences may reflect hormonal or genetic factors
    - Individual variation in lesion distribution patterns

    MEASUREMENT TYPES
    -----------------

    1. Absolute Area (mm²):
       - Direct measurement of lesion area
       - Units: Square millimeters (mm²)
       - Clinical significance: Reflects total lesion load per subtype

    2. Normalized Ratio (%):
       - Lesion area relative to total brain area/volume
       - Units: Percentage (%)
       - Clinical significance: Controls for individual brain size differences

    STATISTICAL APPROACH
    --------------------
    For each combination of:
    - Subgroup (All MS, Female MS, Male MS)
    - Age group (5 categories)
    - Lesion subtype (PEWMH, PAWMH, JCWMH)
    - Metric (Area vs Ratio)

    The following statistics are calculated:
    - Sample size (N)
    - Mean ± Standard Deviation (for visualization)
    - Median and Interquartile Range [Q25-Q75] (for robust statistics)
    - Minimum and Maximum values
    - 25th and 75th percentiles

    Non-parametric Statistics:
    - Mann-Whitney U tests for gender comparisons within each lesion subtype
    - Median and IQR reported for robustness to outliers
    - Appropriate for skewed lesion distribution data

    INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
    -------------------------

    Three-Layer Stacked Plot Interpretation:
    - Bottom layer height = PEWMH mean contribution
    - Middle layer height = PAWMH mean contribution  
    - Top layer height = JCWMH mean contribution
    - Total stack height = Combined lesion burden across all subtypes
    - Layer thickness indicates relative contribution of each subtype

    Clinical Pattern Recognition:
    - Dominant lesion subtype can be identified by layer thickness
    - Age-related changes visible as slope steepness
    - Gender differences apparent by comparing male vs female rows
    - Subtype-specific patterns may indicate different pathological processes

    Expected Subtype Hierarchy:
    - PEWMH often dominant in MS (thickest layer)
    - PAWMH and JCWMH may show age-dependent changes
    - Individual variation in subtype distribution patterns

    GENDER STRATIFICATION ANALYSIS
    -------------------------------
    The analysis includes separate visualizations for:
    1. All MS patients (combined analysis)
    2. Female MS patients only
    3. Male MS patients only

    Gender Comparison Features:
    - Direct visual comparison between male and female patterns
    - Statistical testing for gender differences in each lesion subtype
    - Separate analysis for both area and ratio measurements
    - Age-stratified patterns within each gender

    DATA QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS
    ----------------------------
    - Zero values indicate no subjects in that age/subtype combination
    - Small sample sizes in gender-stratified analyses may reduce statistical power
    - Lesion subtype classification depends on anatomical definition accuracy
    - Manual segmentation variability may affect subtype boundaries
    - Automated methods may have subtype-specific detection biases

    STATISTICAL TESTING METHODOLOGY
    --------------------------------
    Gender Comparisons:
    - Mann-Whitney U test for each lesion subtype
    - Separate tests for area and ratio measurements
    - Non-parametric approach suitable for skewed lesion data
    - Two-sided alternative hypothesis

    Multiple Testing Considerations:
    - Multiple comparisons performed across lesion subtypes
    - Consider Bonferroni correction: α = 0.05/6 = 0.0083 for significance
    - False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction may be more appropriate

    LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
    ------------------------------
    1. Sample Size Limitations:
       - Gender-stratified analyses have reduced sample sizes
       - Some age groups may have insufficient subjects for reliable estimates
       - Power analysis recommended for gender comparisons

    2. Lesion Subtype Definition:
       - Anatomical boundaries between subtypes may be arbitrary
       - Different segmentation protocols may yield different results
       - Spatial resolution limits affecting small lesion detection

    3. Multiple Comparisons:
       - Six statistical tests performed (3 subtypes × 2 metrics)
       - Risk of Type I error inflation
       - Consider correction for multiple testing

    4. Age Group Effects:
       - Discretized age groups may mask continuous relationships
       - Unequal age distributions between genders possible
       - Cross-sectional design limits inferences about progression

    5. MS Disease Heterogeneity:
       - MS subtypes (relapsing-remitting, progressive) not considered
       - Disease duration effects not analyzed
       - Treatment effects not controlled

    RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP ANALYSES
