    AGE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
    -------------------------

    Age distribution is presented using overlapping histograms to allow comparison across groups.
    Statistical measures are calculated for each demographic subgroup:

    HC Male Age Distribution:
    - N = 327
    - Mean ± SD = 34.8 ± 10.8 years
    - Median [IQR] = 35.0 [26.0-42.0] years
    - Range = 18.0-72.0 years

    HC Female Age Distribution:
    - N = 673
    - Mean ± SD = 34.7 ± 9.9 years
    - Median [IQR] = 34.0 [27.0-41.0] years
    - Range = 18.0-74.0 years

    MS Male Age Distribution:
    - N = 108
    - Mean ± SD = 36.6 ± 10.5 years
    - Median [IQR] = 34.5 [29.0-45.2] years
    - Range = 18.0-60.0 years

    MS Female Age Distribution:
    - N = 273
    - Mean ± SD = 37.7 ± 10.2 years
    - Median [IQR] = 37.0 [30.0-44.0] years
    - Range = 18.0-68.0 years

    HISTOGRAM BIN ANALYSIS
    ----------------------

    The age histogram uses 10 bins spanning from 18 to 68 years:

    Bin Structure:
    - Bin Width: 5 years
    - Total Bins: 10
    - Bin Centers: 20.5, 25.5, 30.5, 35.5, 40.5, 45.5, 50.5, 55.5, 60.5, 65.5

    Group Totals in Histogram:
    - HC Male Total: 327
    - HC Female Total: 673
    - MS Male Total: 108
    - MS Female Total: 273

    CLINICAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
    ----------------------------------

    Gender Distribution Patterns:
    - Overall gender balance provides adequate representation for gender-specific analyses
    - HC and MS groups show similar or different gender distributions (compare percentages)
    - Gender imbalances may reflect disease epidemiology (MS is more common in females)

    Age Distribution Patterns:
    - Age ranges allow assessment of age-related effects
    - Overlapping age distributions enable age-matched comparisons between groups
    - Histogram visualization reveals distribution shape and potential outliers

    Study Design Considerations:
    - Balanced demographics support robust statistical comparisons
    - Age and gender matching critical for controlling confounding variables
    - Sample sizes adequate for planned analyses within demographic subgroups

    VISUALIZATION METHODOLOGY
    --------------------------

    Pie Charts (Panels A-C):
    - Standard pie charts with percentage labels
    - Consistent color scheme across panels
    - Start angle: 90 degrees (12 o'clock position)
    - Automatic percentage calculation and display

    Histogram (Panel D):
    - Overlapping histogram with transparency (alpha=0.7)
    - Equal bin widths for fair comparison
    - Legend identifying all four demographic groups
    - Grid overlay for easier value reading
    - Unstacked visualization allows direct comparison of distributions

    Color Scheme:
    - HC Male: #1f77b4 (consistent with pie charts)
    - HC Female: #d62728 (consistent with pie charts)
    - MS Male: #00FF00 (bright green for distinction from HC)
    - MS Female: #FF8C00 (orange for distinction from HC)

    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
    ---------------------------

    Sample Size Adequacy:
    - Overall sample size: 1381 participants
    - Minimum group size: 108
    - Power analysis recommended for planned comparisons

    Age Distribution Assessment:
    - Normality testing may be needed for parametric analyses
    - Non-parametric alternatives available for skewed distributions
    - Age matching strategies should be documented

    Gender Balance:
    - Chi-square tests can assess gender distribution differences between groups
    - Fisher's exact test appropriate for small cell counts
    - Gender stratification may be necessary for some analyses

    QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES
    -------------------------

    Data Validation:
    - Age ranges checked for biological plausibility
    - Gender coding verified (Male/Female only)
    - Missing data patterns assessed and documented

    Visualization Accuracy:
    - Pie chart percentages sum to 100% for each panel
    - Histogram bin counts match raw data
    - Color consistency maintained across panels

    Statistical Verification:
    - Demographic calculations independently verified
    - Age statistics cross-checked with raw data
    - Sample size counts validated against original dataset

    LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
    ------------------------------

    1. Sample Size Limitations:
       - Unequal group sizes may limit some statistical comparisons
       - Small subgroups may have insufficient power for interaction analyses
       - Confidence intervals may be wide for smaller demographic categories

    2. Age Distribution Effects:
       - Cross-sectional design limits inferences about aging effects
       - Age ranges may not capture very young or very old populations
       - Histogram binning may obscure subtle age distribution differences

    3. Gender Representation:
       - Binary gender classification may not reflect participant diversity
       - Gender imbalances may reflect disease epidemiology rather than sampling bias
       - Gender-specific analyses require adequate representation in both categories

    4. Visualization Limitations:
       - Overlapping histograms may obscure some distribution details
       - Pie chart effectiveness decreases with many small categories
       - Color choices may not be accessible to colorblind viewers
