    =========================================================

    Generated on: 2025-09-18 13:00:09

    OVERVIEW
    --------
    This analysis examines ventricular burden in the brain comparing Healthy Controls (HC) 
    and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. The analysis includes both absolute ventricular 
    area measurements and normalized ventricular ratios, stratified by age groups and gender.

    FIGURE DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    The figure consists of a 2x2 subplot layout:

    Layout Structure:
    - Top row: Healthy Controls (HC)
    - Bottom row: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients
    - Left column: Absolute Ventricular Area (mm²)
    - Right column: Ventricular Ratio (%)

    Subplot Details:
    1. Top-Left: HC Ventricular Area
    2. Top-Right: HC Ventricular Ratio  
    3. Bottom-Left: MS Ventricular Area
    4. Bottom-Right: MS Ventricular Ratio

    VISUALIZATION METHOD
    --------------------
    Chart Type: Stacked Area Plot with Gender Contributions
    - Each subplot uses stacked area charts to show gender-stratified data across age groups
    - Male contribution (bottom layer): Shows proportional contribution of male subjects to combined mean
    - Female contribution (top layer): Shows proportional contribution of female subjects to combined mean
    - Total height represents the true weighted combined mean across both genders
    - This visualization allows comparison of both absolute values and relative gender contributions

    Mathematical Approach:
    - Male Contribution = (Male_Count × Male_Mean) / Total_Sum × Combined_Mean
    - Female Contribution = (Female_Count × Female_Mean) / Total_Sum × Combined_Mean
    - Combined Mean = (Male_Count × Male_Mean + Female_Count × Female_Mean) / (Male_Count + Female_Count)

    Color Scheme:
    - Male data: #1f77b4 (alpha=0.7)
    - Female data: #d62728 (alpha=0.7)

    AGE STRATIFICATION
    ------------------
    Age Groups: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+
    Age Bins: [(18, 29), (30, 39), (40, 49), (50, 59), (60, 69)]
    Age Centers (for plotting): ['23.5', '34.5', '44.5', '54.5', '64.5']

    The analysis stratifies data across these age groups to examine age-related changes 
    in ventricular burden for both groups and genders.

    METRICS ANALYZED
    ----------------

    1. Ventricular Area (mm²):
       - Absolute measurement of total ventricular volume
       - Column: TotalVentricleArea
       - Units: Square millimeters (mm²)
       - Clinical significance: Larger values indicate greater ventricular enlargement

    2. Ventricular Ratio (%):
       - Normalized measurement relative to total brain area/volume
       - Column: VentricleRatio
       - Units: Percentage (%)
       - Clinical significance: Controls for individual brain size differences

    ADVANCED STATISTICAL APPROACH
    ------------------------------
    The analysis employs a sophisticated statistical testing framework:

    Normality Assessment:
    - Shapiro-Wilk tests performed on both groups (HC and MS) for each metric
    - Significance threshold: p < 0.05 indicates non-normal distribution
    - Results inform choice between parametric and non-parametric tests

    Statistical Test Selection:
    1. If both groups pass normality: Independent t-test (parametric)
    2. If one or both groups fail normality: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric)

    Effect Size Calculations:
    - Parametric tests: Cohen's d
      * Small effect: d = 0.2
      * Medium effect: d = 0.5  
      * Large effect: d = 0.8
    - Non-parametric tests: Effect size r (r = Z/√N)
      * Small effect: r = 0.1
      * Medium effect: r = 0.3
      * Large effect: r = 0.5

    For each combination of:
    - Group (HC vs MS)
    - Age group (5 categories)
    - Gender (Male vs Female)  
    - Metric (Area vs Ratio)

    The following statistics are calculated:
    - Sample size (N)
    - Mean ± Standard Deviation
    - Minimum and Maximum values
    - Median values
    - Interquartile ranges (for non-parametric reporting)

    STATISTICAL OUTPUT INTERPRETATION
    ---------------------------------

    Parametric Results (t-test):
    - Reports: Mean ± SD for both groups
    - Test statistic: t-value and degrees of freedom
    - p-value for significance testing
    - Cohen's d for effect size magnitude

    Non-parametric Results (Mann-Whitney U):
    - Reports: Mean ± SD AND Median [IQR] for both groups
    - Test statistic: U-value (or equivalent Z-score)
    - p-value for significance testing
    - Effect size r for magnitude assessment

    Normality Test Results:
    - Shapiro-Wilk p-values reported for each group
    - p < 0.05 indicates significant departure from normality
    - Informs test selection rationale

    INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
    -------------------------

    Stacked Area Plot Interpretation:
    - Total height = True combined mean (weighted by sample sizes)
    - Male layer height = Proportional contribution of males to combined mean
    - Female layer height = Proportional contribution of females to combined mean
    - Layer proportions reflect both mean values AND sample size contributions
    - Steeper slopes indicate rapid changes with age
    - Wider differences between groups suggest clinical significance

    Clinical Relevance:
    - Ventricular enlargement is associated with brain atrophy
    - MS patients typically show greater ventricular burden than healthy controls
    - Age-related changes may differ between groups
    - Gender differences may exist in disease progression patterns

    Expected Patterns:
    - MS group likely shows higher values than HC group
    - Age-related increase in ventricular burden
    - Potential gender differences in progression patterns

    Statistical Significance Levels:
    - p < 0.001: Highly significant (strong evidence)
    - p < 0.01: Very significant (moderate to strong evidence)
    - p < 0.05: Significant (sufficient evidence)
    - p ≥ 0.05: Non-significant (insufficient evidence)

    Effect Size Interpretation:
    - Cohen's d or r values indicate practical significance
    - Large effect sizes may be clinically meaningful even if p > 0.05
    - Small p-values with small effect sizes may lack clinical relevance

    DATA QUALITY NOTES
    -------------------
    - Zero values in plots indicate no subjects in that age/gender combination
    - Small sample sizes may lead to unstable mean estimates and reduced statistical power
    - Standard deviations provide insight into data variability within groups
    - Missing data handled by excluding from calculations (listwise deletion)
    - Normality violations automatically trigger non-parametric alternatives

    ENHANCED LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
    ---------------------------------------
    1. Sample Size Variations:
       - Some age/gender combinations may have small sample sizes
       - Unbalanced groups may affect statistical power
       - Power analysis recommended for study design validation

    2. Multiple Comparisons:
       - Two separate statistical tests performed (area and ratio)
       - Consider Bonferroni correction: α = 0.05/2 = 0.025
       - Family-wise error rate may be inflated without correction

    3. Age Grouping Effects:
       - Discretized age groups may mask continuous age effects
       - Loss of information compared to regression approaches
       - Age bin boundaries are predetermined and may not reflect natural breakpoints

    4. Statistical Assumptions:
       - Automatic normality testing with Shapiro-Wilk (sensitive to large samples)
       - Independence assumption may be violated in related subjects
       - Equal variances assumed for t-tests (consider Welch's t-test alternative)

    5. Visualization Limitations:
       - Proportional contributions may be difficult to interpret intuitively
       - Stacked areas emphasize combined effects over individual gender patterns
       - Direct visual comparison between groups requires careful interpretation

    6. Clinical Interpretation:
       - Statistical significance may not equal clinical significance
       - Effect sizes should be considered alongside p-values
       - Longitudinal changes not captured in cross-sectional analysis

    RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP ANALYSES
    ------------------------------
    1. Advanced Statistical Approaches:
       - Age as continuous variable (linear/polynomial regression)
       - Two-way ANOVA with interaction terms (group × gender × age)
       - Mixed-effects models for correlated data
       - Bootstrap confidence intervals for robust inference

    2. Multiple Comparisons Corrections:
       - Bonferroni correction for family-wise error control
       - False Discovery Rate (FDR) control for exploratory analyses
       - Planned comparisons vs. post-hoc testing strategies

    3. Effect Size and Power Analysis:
       - Post-hoc power calculations for observed effects
       - Sample size calculations for future studies
       - Confidence intervals around effect size estimates

    4. Alternative Statistical Approaches:
       - Bayesian analysis for probabilistic interpretation
       - Permutation tests for distribution-free inference
       - Robust statistical methods for outlier resistance

    5. Clinical Validation:
       - Correlation with clinical severity measures
       - Longitudinal tracking of ventricular changes
       - Predictive modeling for disease progression
